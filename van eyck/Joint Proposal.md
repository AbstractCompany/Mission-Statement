|||||||||I TRIED TO MESH ALL OUR IDEAS TOGETHER IN TO ONE ESSAY FOR US TO CONTINUE TO WORK ON. WE NEED THAT ART EXAMPLE THAT YOU SAID YOU WOUD LOOK FOR. ANY IDEAS YET? WHEN YOU GET IT MAYBE YOU CAN WRITE A SHORT PARAGRAPH ABOUT IT AND THEN ILL TRY TO ADD IT IN? SO BELOW ALL THIS IS THE WHOLE ESSAY WITHOUT SPACE FOR COMMENTS. PLEASE LET ME KNOW WHAT YOU THINK OF IT AS A WHOLE AND WHAT NEEDS TO BE ADDED SPECIFICALLY.||||||||||




We propose to design a furniture system that will become the platform for non-hierarchal learning workshops that would allow for the distribution of knowledge of systems theory and relevant art practices, visually, physically, and digitally. 


[i think we should add in art to this mix because i think it is strongest with all three]
|||||OK BUT HOW, “THAT RESULT IN ART AS ACTION?”|||||


Inspired by the interconnected nature of design and education seen in the work of Enzo Mari and Ken Isaacs, we pose the question, “How can education and spatial relationships inform art practices?”


Both Enzo Mari and Ken Isaac saw their work as informative, capable of expressing systems which the user is engulfed in, specifically the capitalist agenda of the cold-war era. 


One of the tools central to their and many other radical artist's practices, is the dissemination of information through non-traditional means. 


By disseminating the instructions for constructing their designs they had hoped to empower users to acknowledge design thinking and intent through process. 







We aim to design with simplicity, utility, and durability. 


Our furniture system will be easy to build by hand from readily available materials. 


These furniture pieces will act together to inform the user of the systems in which they are a part of (political and economical) by inserting them directly into another (structural) system. 


This idea aligns with Ken Isaacs’s methods to allow for students to become “agents of synthesis by learning through praxis rather than passive digestion.” 


Once the form of the furniture system has been designed and realized we will create an instruction manual that will be freely available through digital downloads on an on-going blog. 


This manual will discuss the construction as well as the intentions of the system, becoming another platform for distribution and education. 






Finally we will invite the public to participate in a workshop utilizing our furniture prototypes to materialize the ideas of systems theory, a concept central to the work of Isaacs and Mari. 


In this workshop we will challenge the participants’ interactions with space, imagery, materials and environments to understand the process in which we position ourselves and our ideas in a complex interconnected world. 

[i think we need to say specifically other people]
|||||WHAT OTHER PEOPLE? THE PARTICIPANTS?||||||||


The workshop will contain a short talk and a group discussion followed by dispersion into smaller units to explore and develop specific utilizations of the furniture concurrent with these ideas. 


During the course of the workshop we will examine the push and pull between the furniture and the participants to understand nescessary modifications in our behavior to adapt to the built environment and the ability for us to adapt furniture for a social environment. 


The result of the systems examination workshop will be on public display at Van Eyck and discussed critically through the publication of a workshop manual, that discusses the furniture construction and instructional methods for a reproduction of the workshop. 


As the furniture is reproduced and workshops are retaught we encourage the exchange of ideas and modifications of both design and educational methods through our blog to further improve the communication of ideas and thoughts. 


The lessons learned from the workshop will be inscribed back into the furniture system to produce the second iteration.
