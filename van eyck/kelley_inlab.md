We encounter “systems” in all aspects of life, from environmental systems and capital systems to social systems; they are everywhere. 



During this in-lab we will examine systems theory as it relates directly to the individual through both cognitive and physical experiences. 



Through a series of three [I don't think we should say the exact number] discussion/reading/lecture groups focusing on political, educational, and structural systems, respectively we will examine how systems can result in radical changes in our built environments that then effect our cognitive sensibilities (or vice versa). 


 [I don't think we should say the exact number]
|||||THE NUMBER HAS TO DO WITH THE TOPICS WE EXPLORE||||||
[the way the call is written it seems like we are laying out the ideas that the in-lab would seek to cover not the practical things like the number]

[i think we should add a few other things like this]
|||||A FEW OTHER THINGS LIKE WHAT?||||||||
[i was saying we should start a list] 


|||||THESE ARE SOME NOTES I THINK MIGHT BE HELPFUL FOR FORMING THIS IDEA|||||||

Luhmann himself described his theory as "labyrinth-like" or "non-linear" and claimed he was deliberately keeping his prose enigmatic to prevent it from being understood "too quickly", which would only produce simplistic misunderstandings 

^this idea might be interesting to think about in how we propose the workshop/furniture

The core element of Luhmann's theory is communication. [i think we need to emphasize this as it is the connection to almost everything] 

Social systems are systems of communication, and society is the most encompassing social system. Being the social system that comprises all (and only) communication, today's society is a world society. [I think that we both a firmly within the realm of social systems and that the connections between different social systems is the main focus of lots of our work]

^i think emphasising this as the key part of the workshop could be neat

 A system is defined by a boundary between itself and its environment, dividing it from an infinitely complex, or (colloquially) chaotic, exterior. 

The interior of the system is thus a zone of reduced complexity: Communication within a system operates by selecting only a limited amount of all information available outside. [do we need to talk about this so we can kind of explain some of the system theory we are going to be jumping into or should that be more left to the imagination?]

^like a filter

Social systems are operationally closed in that while they use and rely on resources from their environment, those resources do not become part of the systems' operation. [this is good and think we should include it]

The most important difference is that Parsons used systems merely as an analytic tool to understand certain processes going on in society; Luhmann, in contrast, treats his vision of systems ontologically, saying that "systems exist". That is, Luhmann in fact suggests to substitute the paradigm of systems theory for the ontological paradigm: the difference system/environment (which also signifies a relationship).

the communicative actions of people are constituted (but not defined) by society, and society is constituted (but not defined) by the communicative actions of people: society is people's environment, and people are society's environment. Thus, sociology can explain how persons can change society; the influence of the environment (the people) on the system (the society), the so-called “structural coupling”.
