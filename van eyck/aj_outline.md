	In the last 20 years many in the art and design world have turned inward driven by the nilism produced by the crushing critique of the modern utopian master narratives. These narratives lay waste to the world in the name of progress and un___ universal ideals, but now left simply with cynicism it is hard not to long for a time when 
	
	A few designers in the mid-twentieth century put forward tools instead of products, and while many of them staid in the shadows of the design world a few broke out and where able to provide us with tools to reorganize our lives (Ken Isaacs and Enzo Mari). Yet some of the best codification of the need for this type of system was Donald Judd in his 


The Goal
	
	There are a limited number of ways that people orient themselves for learning(etc)
	Just as one cannot think what one does not have words for one cannot act what one does not have models for 
	The production of new models for face-to-face learning learning
	

	We operate in metaphors through which we understand the world and are able to build complex systems for the _____, but if we do not have the models for behavior we are not able to imagine these ways of behaving. Just as one cannot think with language we cannot act without models. 

The Project


	In response to the sweeping instrumentalisation of all areas of life we propose to create a system for alternative ways of interacting. The basic equipment for life has been inscribed with ideology, and for these new modes of interaction we need new orientations of our lives. to this end we propose to create a system of furniture that will allow for these new modes. This system will also be inscribed with an ideology of opposition/antagonism. The best conceptual way to oppose the complex milieu is with the simple power of the hand. The only restrictions place on the system is that it must be made out of basic easy to obtain materials and be able to be constructed by hand by two people.  
	
We propose to build a furniture system to serve as the platform for non-hierarchical learning methods that would align with the conceptual practices of Donald Judd’s sculptures and furniture with the methods of Ken Isaacs and Enzo Mari. 

For Judd the experiential effects upon the viewer were of utmost importance; resulting in a physical grounding and an increased awareness of the present.

The methods of Isaacs and Mari where series of steps that would result in object or tools for the orientation of everyday life. Both Isaacs and Mari discriminated their work not as commercially produced, but as recipes for the furniture and structures.


	The production of a system of furniture that can be made by hand out of simple materials 
	The distribution of this system through free and open channels
	The hosting of workshops to utilize the furniture (happening)

IN-LAB

The open source in-lab
	The subject of copyright and access butt into one another what does it mean for work to be free and how is the artist to be sustained 
	
	The application of new media modes to non-software models 




The Instructions as tools in-lab
	Since even before the 1970s the roll of instructions in art had already been established, but the fine arts where the last to catch on. 
	Open work - 
	What does it mean for the art to live in a hibernate state
