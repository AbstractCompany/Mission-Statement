Taking as our object of critique the current state of education and the stagnate state that has overtake much art education with a focus on employment and professionalism. Both Enzo Mari and Ken Isaac provide examples of how alliterative ______ have provided new tools to think about problems of their day, and they have enabled opposition to systems that seem insurmountable, specifically the cold-war era capitalist juggernaut. One of the central tools to their and many radical artist's practices is the dissemination of information through non-_______ means. the open source theories of information are both a sting critique of the instamentialsion of _____________(education) and a tool by which we can start to reorient education towards _________ with the goal of dismantling the present broken system. 
	 
With the aim of producing a simple and easily distributed system we propose to create a system of furniture that can be used for alternative learning environments. The furniture will be easy to build by hand out of readily available materials, and will be a model for choreographing pedagogical interactions not inscribed with the current instrumentalist ideology. 

Using the system that we develop we will then hold educational workshops as social performances targeting the ways in which learning is assumed to happen. The instructions for both the workshops and the furniture will then be packaged and distributed freely on the internet and through printed artist prints.

	Inspired by the interconnected nature of design and education seen in the work of Enzo Mari and Ken Isaacs, we propose to design a furniture system that will become the platform for non-hierarchal learning workshops. 

	Both Enzo Mari and Ken Isaac saw their work as informative, capable of expressing systems in which the user is surrounded by, specifically the capitalist agenda of the cold-war era. 


	By disseminating the instructions for constructing their designs they had hoped that by allowing users would become empowered and able to acknowledge design thinking and intent. 

	The concern of both of these designers with the role of education in the built environment makes their work the perfect foundation for our design of systems for alternative learning environments. 

	We aim to design with simplicity, utility, and durability as the main goals of our system. 

	Our system will be made of solid easily available materials and connectors. 

	These furniture pieces will act together to inform the user of the systems in which they are a part of (political and economical) by inserting them directly into another (structural) system. 

	This idea aligns with Ken Isaacs’s methods to allow for students to become “agents of synthesis by learning through praxis rather than passive digestion.” 

	Once the form of the furniture system has been designed and realized we will create an instruction manual that will be freely available through digital methods. This manual will discuss the construction as well as the intentions of the system, becoming another platform for dissemination and education that mirrors that of Mari and Isaacs. Finally we will invite the public to participate in a workshop utilizing our furniture prototypes to materialize the ideas of systems theory. In this workshop we will challenge the participants’ interactions with space, imagery, materials and environments to understand the process in which to position themselves and their ideas in a complex interconnected world. The workshop will contain a short talk and a group discussion followed by dispersion into smaller units to explore and develop specific utilizations of the furniture centered around these ideas. The result of the systems examination workshop will be on public display at Van Eyck.
