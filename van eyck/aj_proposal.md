Following the creation of the first iteration of the furniture we will hold a workshop where the system will be implement.

Within the workshops peoples ideas about space, imagery, and context will be challenged so as to break down our abstract understanding and replace it with a more literal understanding of things.  

We will try to go through at lest three iterations before we release the written instructions for the production of the finalized[i don't like this word] furniture system. 

These instructions will be distributed both in print and online through social media and blogs. The
