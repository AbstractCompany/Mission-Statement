[i really like this but i think it should be said more directly like 'if people build a table with their hands they understand the tables ideology']By the word autoprogettazione Mari means an exercise to be carried out individually to improve one’s personal understanding of the sincerity behind the project. To make this possible you are guided through an archetypal and very simple technique. Therefore the end product, although usable, is only important because of its educational value. A project for making easy-to-assemble furniture using rough boards and nails.[The end product, although usable, is important because of the educational value of creating it][maybe we don't say rough but something more like raw or natural]Transfer of information becomes experiential ken issaacs

[i think we should add in art to this mix because i think it is strongest with all three]

Both Enzo Mari and Ken Isaac saw their work as informative, capable of expressing systems in which the user is surrounded by, specifically the capitalist agenda of the cold-war era. By disseminating the instructions for constructing their designs they had hoped that by allowing users would become empowered and able to acknowledge design thinking and intent. The concern of both of these designers with the role of education in the built environment makes their work the perfect foundation for our design of systems for alternative learning environments. We aim to design with simplicity, utility, and durability as the main goals of our system. Our system will be made of solid easily available materials and connectors. These furniture pieces will act together to inform the user of the systems in which they are a part of (political and economical) by inserting them directly into another (structural) system. This idea aligns with Ken Isaacs’s methods to allow for students to become “agents of synthesis by learning through praxis rather than passive digestion.” Once the form of the furniture system has been designed and realized we will create an instruction manual that will be freely available through digital methods. This manual will discuss the construction as well as the intentions of the system, becoming another platform for dissemination and education that mirrors that of Mari and Isaacs.Finally we will invite the public to participate in a workshop utilizing our furniture prototypes to materialize the ideas of systems theory, a concept central to the work of Isaacs and Mari. In this workshop we will challenge the participants’ interactions with space, imagery, materials and environments to understand the process in which to position themselves and their ideas in a complex interconnected world. The workshop will contain a short talk and a group discussion followed by dispersion into smaller units to explore and develop specific utilizations of the furniture centered around these ideas. The result of the systems examination workshop will be on public display at Van Eyck.|||||I THINK THE ONE THING MISSING HERE IS HOW EXACTLY OUR PROJECT ISNT JUST RECREATING THEIR PROJECTS?|||||

ALSO I THINK I REALLY LIKE USING “|” AS MY BRACKETS I CLAIM THIS.____________________in-labs__________________________
We encounter “systems” in all aspects of life, from environmental systems and capital systems to social systems; they are everywhere. During this in-lab we will examine systems theory as it relates directly to the individual through both cognitive and physical experiences. Through a series of three discussion/reading/lecture groups focusing on political, educational, and structural systems, respectively we will examine how systems can result in radical changes in our built environments that then effect our cognitive sensibilities (or vice versa).   


|||||THESE ARE SOME NOTES I THINK MIGHT BE HELPFUL FOR FORMING THIS IDEA|||||||

Luhmann himself described his theory as "labyrinth-like" or "non-linear" and claimed he was deliberately keeping his prose enigmatic to prevent it from being understood "too quickly", which would only produce simplistic misunderstandings 

^this idea might be interesting to think about in how we propose the workshop/furniture

The core element of Luhmann's theory is communication. Social systems are systems of communication, and society is the most encompassing social system. Being the social system that comprises all (and only) communication, today's society is a world society.

^i think emphasising this as the key part of the workshop could be neat

 A system is defined by a boundary between itself and its environment, dividing it from an infinitely complex, or (colloquially) chaotic, exterior. 

The interior of the system is thus a zone of reduced complexity: Communication within a system operates by selecting only a limited amount of all information available outside. 

^like a filter

Social systems are operationally closed in that while they use and rely on resources from their environment, those resources do not become part of the systems' operation. 

The most important difference is that Parsons used systems merely as an analytic tool to understand certain processes going on in society; Luhmann, in contrast, treats his vision of systems ontologically, saying that "systems exist". That is, Luhmann in fact suggests to substitute the paradigm of systems theory for the ontological paradigm: the difference system/environment (which also signifies a relationship).

the communicative actions of people are constituted (but not defined) by society, and society is constituted (but not defined) by the communicative actions of people: society is people's environment, and people are society's environment. Thus, sociology can explain how persons can change society; the influence of the environment (the people) on the system (the society), the so-called “structural coupling”.
