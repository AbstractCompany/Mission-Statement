[in the future i think you need to make your sentences way less complicated. its hard for me to read them when you are using complicated language and structure. make the idea very clear and short.]

instead of:
Taking as our object of critique the current state of education and the stagnate state that has overtake much art education with a focus on employment and professionalism. 

[try something like:
we are interested in critiquing educational systems. specifically those that focus on employment and professionalism as the appropriate outcome of art education instead of __________ (Creativity and knowledge or experimentation?)]

[-BUT is that really what this is about? i was under the impression that we were trying to instill educational methods and the focus of the workshop through physical, experiential, relational, and cognitive systems/spaces.] ||||???????||||||

Both Enzo Mari and Ken Isaac provide examples of how alliterative ______ have provided new tools to think about problems of their day. They have enabled opposition to systems that seem insurmountable, specifically the cold-war era capitalist juggernaut. 

[-WHAT ARE THE PROBLEMS OF THEIR DAY?] the same ones we are dealing with today

||||I WAS HOPING FOR A LIST OF SPECIFICS OR IDEAS YOU WANTED TO FOCUS ON|||||||


One of the central tools to their and many radical artist's practices is the dissemination of information through non-_______ means. the open source theories of information are both a sting (?) critique of the instamentialsion (?) of _____________(education) and a tool by which we can start to reorient education towards _________ with the goal of dismantling the present broken system. 

[-are we thinking this grand? or just specifically presenting an alternative? i think in line with mari and isaacs they would be less assertive/preachy/end of the world!!! and maybe talk about their feelings and a more approachable way.]
	 
With the aim of producing a simple and easily distributed system we propose to create a system of furniture that can be used for alternative learning environments. The furniture will be easy to build by hand out of readily available materials, and will be a model for choreographing pedagogical interactions not inscribed with the current instrumentalist ideology. 

[-the last part is where you lost me, "will be a model for choreographing pedagogical interactions not inscribed with the current instrumentalist ideology" im not sure what you telling me it does. maybe a different word choice?]?????????

Using the system that we develop we will then hold educational workshops as social performances targeting the ways in which learning is assumed to happen. The instructions for both the workshops and the furniture will then be packaged and distributed freely on the internet and through printed artist prints. 

[-“social performances"???? i was under the impression that the workshop nor the furniture were the art but the interaction of participants was the art.]?????????

[-targeting the ways in which learning is assumed to happen... are we doing this? im confused. i thought we were using alternative learning methods. maybe im misunderstanding what youre saying here….]?????????

[-i didnt think about the intructions for the workshops that might be hard to write but a really great idea]
