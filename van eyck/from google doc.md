Project Description:
 
“design is only good design if it educates the user.” -enzo mari

During our two-month stay in Marfa, Texas we propose to build a furniture system to serve as the platform for non-hierarchical learning methods that would align with the conceptual practices of Donald Judd’s sculptures. For Judd the experiential effects upon the viewer were of utmost importance; resulting in a physical grounding and an increased awareness of the present. Our furniture models will reinforce these ideas as the foundation of our specific workshops. Marfa, Texas has a rich history of territorial conflicts and mixed cultural identities making it acutely aware of both the shared past and present which must constantly be negotiated with others. The physical and cultural awareness of Marfa create the ideal location in which to hold our initial workshop.
 
We will begin our residency through a research-intensive period of examining Judd’s furniture and sculptures for formal and conceptual queues which can be translated into our new system. Through several test models we aim to develop a series of rules for our systems to express utility as the utmost importance to the design. After identifying a successful model platform for experiential education, we will design a construction manual that will be made available for free, in both physical and digital mediums, for public distribution. During the last week of the residency we will invite the public to participate in a workshop that utilizes our furniture prototypes to materialize these ideas about the physical space between one and another. In this workshop we will examine physical versus metaphoric encounters with objects, the central ideas of Judd’s 1965 essay "Specific Objects". The workshop will contain a short talk and a group discussion followed by dispersion into smaller units to explore and develop specific utilizations of the furniture centered around these ideas. The final presentation will be presented at Fieldwork Headquarters in Marfa.

		DIY 
		self sufficiency
		adaptability 
		
	- Radical modes of distribution of ideas (Open source, Internet, PDF, Torrent)
		why?
		democratic 
		provides building blocks to be used by others so there is progress is not impeded 
	- Alternative learning environments
		why?
		cost
		subject specificy
		non-hierarchical
		 
		
		The current educational landscape is fraught bleak with few good options and instrumentalization everywhere. The desire to learn has not disappeared just many of the opportunities.   		
	- platform (for co-learning environments)
		The activation of the viewer. we make the stage and they perform and are liberated. 
	- alignment with van eyck non-academic standing
		platform as an exchange and participation knowledge base

Distribution of a platform for co-learning environments

Statement of work (individual):
I produce work of an interdisciplinary nature, often negotiating the boundaries and overlaps of art, architecture and design. Upon receiving her Masters in Three Dimensional Design from Cranbrook Academy of Art, she moved to Quezon City in the Philippines to pursue research into the connections of human consciousness and kinetic architecture through examining informal communities surrounding landfills. As part of a Fulbright grant she is currently working on a series of installation works, and community-based projects in Payatas, Quezon City.

My work focuses on the architecture of interaction. Coming from an architecture and design background, my work acts as a means of understanding social environments and interaction. I often use construction materials such as bright fluorescent lights, mylar, 2x4s, plywood, acrylic paint, concrete. My material choices are driven by the conceptual needs of each project and my past. I view architecture as a diagram of the social condition; an abstraction of the culture that procures it. The built environment becomes a recorded history of a place’s socio-economic status, and how this history effects the present. My process of investigation begins with intensive research culminating in performances, installations, and collaborations to communicate the memory of a place.

My practice currently pursue research into the connections of human consciousness and kinetic architecture through examining informal communities surrounding landfills. As part of a Fulbright grant I am currently working on a series of installation works, and community-based projects in Payatas, Quezon City, 

Through my work I am interested in examining change and history to question authority, value, and ownership of communities. I aim to communicate the ideas of social responsibility and pride of place through dialogue. The goal of my practice is to act as a disturbance to raise awareness of the histories that we are part of and provide new paths for alternative histories to be conceived.











Anthony Warnick is a multi-disciplinary artist whose practice spans interactive media installation, performative interventions, and printed matter, focusing on histories and institutions. He was an Art(its) On The Verge fellow in 2012-2013 during which he made a library entirely of books found online that he altered with custom software. As a MFA candidate in sculpture at Cranbrook Academy of Art, he currently is working to disrupt systems as an agent of entropy. 

My work is interpositions realized as gestural performances or interventions. The performances utilize my body along with materials already present in the performance location. The use of a body gives form to the often unseen frameworks that control interactions between people. These performances have taken many forms including a baptism in a fountain, shoveling an used but neglected sidewalk, a protest with out words, and drawing a chalk line along a wall. The other side of the work is interventions aimed at giving the viewer an altered perception of some element of the institution. The interventions are often made of drywall, 2x4's, plywood, newsprint, and copy paper. The use of common and simple materials is to shift the focus from the object to the ideas and context (that the object embodies) which often is the key to the work. My interventions have confronted people through constructing a billboard, ordering from Walmart a reproduction of a famous handmade tapestry, and adding my name as a donor in a lecture hall. 
					



				
Kelley O’Brien and Anthony Warnick met at Cranbrook Academy of Art in 2013 and began working together as Abstract Company. Their work examines change and history to question authority, value, modernism, and social systems. They are currently collaborating on cross-continental work involving members in Detroit, Dublin, and Quezon City focuses on creating a set of essays about the idea of abstraction.		
		

 









(group)
Abstract Company was founded in 2013 as platform for making work based around post-fordian production and _________. We follow best business practices in all areas from research to production. As an adaptable group of artist, architects, philosophers, we share a common believe in the 


At all times we follow both the ISO 9000 and ISO 14001, and _______. The ____ understand systems and how all life is being 

We break down concrete realities, specific objects, or systems into the their primary part to better understand both the systems themselves and the other systems with which they interact. 








 (maybe say something about abstract company and francis?) Their first collaboration, a cross-continental work involving members in Detroit, Dublin and Quezon City is to create a dictionary of terms discussing the idea of abstraction, is currently in progress. They hope to continue to work together through WHAT?


Futurefarmers is a group of diverse practitioners aligned through an interest in making work that is relevant to the time and place surrounding us. Founded in 1995, the design studio serves as a platform to support art projects, an artist in residence program and our research interests. We are artists, researchers, designers, architects, scientists and farmers with a common interest in creating frameworks for exchange that catalyze moments of "not knowing". 

While we collaborate with scientists and are interested in scientific inquiry, we want to ask questions more openly. Through participatory projects, we create spaces and experiences where the logic of a situation disappears - encounters occur that broaden, rather than narrow perspectives, i.e. reductionist science.

We use various media to create work that has the potential to destabilize logics of "certainty". We deconstruct systems such as food policies, public transportation and rural farming networks to visualize and understand their intrinsic logics. Through this disassembly new narratives emerge that reconfigure the principles that once dominated these systems. Our work often provides a playful entry point and tools for participants to gain insight into deeper fields of inquiry- not only to imagine, but to participate in and initiate change in the places we live.

Collectively, we teach in the visual arts graduate programs at California College of the Arts in San Francisco, Mills College in Oakland, California and the joint masters program of art and engineering at Stanford University.


I have included my cv for you to give me feedback on things to add or take away. 

I was also thinking we could each include like 5 or 6 projects with maybe one or two images? how many should we include and how many images? 

 
> My choices are: 
> 1)thesis (both video and installation) 
> 2)the benches 
> 3)the river lines (video) 
> 4)the park 
> 5) maybe we could include the protest as something we did together as well? 


> what do you think? 
> 
> would you be able to put together and submit the pdf if i give you all the required materials? 






----------

For Judd the non-metamorphic effects on the viewer present with the work was of utmost importance.


  Our furniture models will then apply this interest in being physically grounded and aware of the present to create objects as the apparatus of specific workshops aimed at reinforcing the ideals embodied our furniture. 




phenomenological encounter of objects over metaphoric experience of objects




We will then, in the last week of the residency, hold a workshop, in which we will utilize our furniture prototypes as we invite the public to materialize these ideas of physical realization of space and the other. 


 invite the public to interact with our furniture prototypes and take part in creating their own physical manifestations of explorations into interactions with individuals that mimic ones interaction with Judd’s sculptures within an alternative pedagogical setting.
